# Task - 0x03. Git

Git is a distributed version control system that helps software developers to manage changes to their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most widely used tools in the industry.

With Git, developers can track changes to their codebase, collaborate with other team members, and revert to previous versions of their code if necessary. It works by creating a repository that stores all the versions of a project's code, allowing developers to create branches to work on specific features or bug fixes, and then merge them back into the main codebase once complete.

Git is especially popular for its ability to facilitate collaboration between multiple developers working on the same codebase simultaneously, as it allows developers to work on their own branches without interfering with the work of others. This makes it an essential tool for large-scale software development projects.
